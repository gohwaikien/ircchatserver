# ircchatserver
IRC Chat Server in C++

In this project, I implemented a IRC server (In the IRCChat folder)

- The chat server will have multiple chat rooms and the users can enter a room and type messages. 
- The messages will be seen by all the users in the room. 
- Only users who have entered a room can post messages in the room.

Using Qt, I also developed a IRC client GUI to communicate with the IRC Server.
